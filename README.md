# 🧭 Smart Onboarding Platform

A full-stack onboarding platform built with **Django (Backend)** and **Next.js (Frontend)**.  
It allows admins to dynamically create and manage onboarding forms with customizable fields (text, number, date, dropdown, checkbox, file upload), while users can fill and submit these forms easily.  
Admins are notified asynchronously when new submissions arrive using **Celery + Redis**.

## Design Justification

Dynamic form schema stored as JSON in backend → highly scalable & allows new field types.

Admin configuration via UI → non-technical users can design forms.

Celery handles async notifications → keeps the main app responsive.

Redis ensures reliable task queueing.

Next.js provides modern, reactive UX and SSR capabilitie
